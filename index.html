<!-- <h3>Review 1</h3>
<p>author: TH. El Cerrito</p>
<p>I don't post a lot of reviews but didn't want to miss the opportunity to give the RoosterGrin Team a shout-out here on Yelp. I really appreciate the fact that they are so attentive to my needs as well as the needs of my clients. They always make me feel appreciated and that combined with the peace of mind they provide is priceless. I highly recommend them to those looking from anything from a website to phone systems to high-quality dental software. They never disappoint! Thank you for being so kind and awesome, RoosterGrin!</p>


<h3>Review 2</h3>
<p>author: Susan B. </p>
<p>Rooster Grin is an excellent company! I hired them to do my SEO and within a few days I received calls inquiring about my business, I also use Rooster Grin for my web-hosting which is very affordable and seamless, when I have an issue I email mail them and with in a few minutes I get a response, They are calm, kind, very professional and very on point, they can explain anything I do not understand in a way that is easy for me to understand what is going on. They are available 24 hours a day 7 days a week . I appreciate how careful they are and how easy they are to communicate with me and how quickly. I recently asked them to host my work email and they had it up and running in a matter of minutes at a very reasonable price.
Great Company, Great service, nice people very personable!</p>


<h3>Review 3</h3>

<p>These folks have been very helpful when dealing with some pretty complicated website transitions. There was something about a multi-site that needed to be addressed and Rooster Grin was able to separate our site. They set a fixed price and far exceeded their time allocation but never charged another cent. In the end they've fixed any glitches and the site is finally liberated! They're now hosting two of our sites and I'm grateful to have this local resource just a call away.</p> -->
