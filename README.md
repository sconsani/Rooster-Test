  1. What technologies you used and why? (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

    I used html, css as well as bootstrap. I found working with bootstrap helpful for this project in building a grid system, as well as for creating buttons. Using the columns set up by bootstrap is a clear way for me to layout the text I needed to display for each section of the strips. 

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?

    My biggest struggle I faced was making the site mobile responsive. I think I could have better set up my css file to have organized sections for different viewpoints. I had a hard time with managing the background images and transitioning them into background colors when it got to mobile size.

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why.

  	I really enjoyed this assignment because I love the challenge to translate client given materials and requirements into a functional, good looking design. I also had fun with having some flexibility in design and getting to keep to user in mind for what would be the best experience.
