  1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
    I used html, css and js, as well as bootstrap. I found working with bootstrap helpful for this project in building a grid system, as well as for creating buttons. Using the columns set up by bootstrap is a clear way for me to layout which sections of the row I wanted to display text in for each strip.

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose.
    My biggest struggle I faced was making the site mobile responsive. I think I could have better set up my css file to have organized sections for different viewpoints. But I still had a hard time with managing the background images. I wanted to change each banner image to disappear and a background color to appear when the window size got small. 

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why.
